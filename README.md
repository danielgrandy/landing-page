# landing-page
it's a page..... for landing

This will be a test of my skills to create a landing page from scratch, using my newly-obtained knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Skills demonstrated should be setting up a responsive web design using flexbox which will size to the user's window, setting up fonts, colors, backgrounds, images, cards, title/headers, and other such basics.

Wellll.... I haven't mastered the sizing to the window part as I couldn't get some pieces to shrink or stay on the page when the window was shrunk, possibly due to auto margins and such.... but we'll save that for another learning moment.

Edit: I did get everything centered as I wanted, except for the wrapping text in the bio, which after like 2 hours of googling I learned that flex containers can't be made to shrink to fit wrapped text, apparently? Thus when the text wraps, it becomes un-centered. A main solve for this in many circumstances would simply be to set text-align to center, but in this case I want the text to be left-aligned and thus I can't use that "fix". Still, it's hardly a noticeable issue except at a few specific window widths, and supposedly there is a JavaScript fix, which I'll hopefully learn later.
