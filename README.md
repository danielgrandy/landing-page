# landing-page
it's a page..... for landing

This will be a test of my skills to create a landing page from scratch, using my newly-obtained knowledge of HTML and CSS.

Skills demonstrated should be setting up a responsive web design using flexbox which will size to the user's window, setting up fonts, colors, backgrounds, images, cards, title/headers, and other such basics.

Wellll.... I haven't mastered the sizing to the window part as I couldn't get some pieces to shrink or stay on the page when the window was shrunk, possibly due to auto margins and such.... but we'll save that for another learning moment.
